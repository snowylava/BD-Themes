Default (Mod)
===================
Thanks for choosing my themes. (<i class="icon-file"></i> **Default (Mod)**) is basic, but I'm sure more complex, better looking ones will come by soon.
> ****Default (Mod)** Features:**

> - Title Bar with Logo
> - **アザグエン**'s RainbowKitten Theme Rainbow keyframes
> - Radial Status by **Zerebos**
> - Title Bar with Discord logo and Minimise, re-sixe, close buttons
> - Smaller Server icons, works great with 2 & 3 column server grid

Please Note this is my first theme, its buggy and since Discord changes code, it may not be up to date when you download it.
