Destiny 2™ Theme
===================
Destiny 2 Theme with a GIF as the main background, custom colors, and more coming soon.
Looks a lot better with Discord's Dark Theme pre-selected.
> ****Destiny 2™ Theme** Features:**

> - Title Bar
> - Rainbow keyframes on Owner Plugin and Bot Tag
> - Destiny 2 GIF background
> - Smaller Server icons, works great with 2 & 3 column server grid

Please Note this is my first theme, its buggy and since Discord changes code, it may not be up to date when you download it.
